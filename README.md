Tired of farming blind in the Black Zone? OpenRadar shows you resources, mobs, and players around you, right in your
browser.

**How does it work?** The app listens to network traffic between your PC and Albion's servers, decodes the Photon
protocol, and displays everything on a web-based radar. No client modification, no memory injection. Just passive
reading.

---

## Quick Start

### Windows

1. Install **[Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download)** (required for packet capture).
2. Download `OpenRadar-windows-amd64.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/Nouuu/Albion-Online-OpenRadar/releases).
3. Run it. The radar auto-selects your active LAN interfaces; the startup banner prints both the localhost URL and a `http://<your-lan-ip>:5001 (LAN)` URL when one is available.
4. Open **http://localhost:5001** in your browser, or the LAN URL from a phone or second device on the same network.
5. Launch Albion and start playing. To change which interfaces the radar listens on, open the **Settings -> Network** page.

### Linux

```bash
# Install libpcap
sudo apt install libpcap0.8  # Debian/Ubuntu

# Download and set permissions
chmod +x OpenRadar-linux-amd64
sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip ./OpenRadar-linux-amd64

# Run
./OpenRadar-linux-amd64
```

### CLI Options

```bash
OpenRadar -version       # Show version
OpenRadar -ip X.X.X.X    # One-shot interface override by IP (does not write network.json)
OpenRadar -dev           # Development mode (read files from disk)
```

Persistent interface selection lives in `network.json` next to the binary. Edit it from the **Settings -> Network** page in the browser, or by hand for headless setups.

### Using ExitLag?

ExitLag's default packet redirection method (WFP) intercepts Albion's traffic
above the NDIS layer, so Npcap (and Wireshark, and OpenRadar) sees nothing.

In ExitLag, open **Settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Packet redirection method**
and select **NDIS (Legacy)**. The radar will then capture normally on your
physical adapter.

## What It Detects

### Production-Ready

| What          | Coverage                                                                                          |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resources** | 3,698 nodes validated. T1-T8, enchanted (.1 .2 .3), static and skinnable                          |
| **Mobs**      | 4,528 catalogued. Color-coded: green (normal), purple (enchanted), orange (mini-boss), red (boss) |
| **Players**   | Faction flags, hostile detection, zone-aware alerts                                               |
| **Zones**     | 1,000+ zones mapped. Safe/Yellow/Red/Black detection drives threat logic                          |

### Player Threat Detection

| Status  | Color     | Description             |
|---------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Passive | `#00ff88` | Not flagged for PvP     |
| Faction | `#ffa500` | Faction warfare flagged |
| Hostile | `#ff0000` | Hostile (flagged 255)   |

> **Alert System**: Screen flash + sound on hostile detection

### Mists

- **Portals** (Solo, Duo) detected with rarity (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary)
- **Feu follets** (wisp signs) shown before portals appear
- **Wisp cages** detected inside Mists zones

### Dungeons

Solo, Group (Duo), Corrupted, and Hellgate filters all validated end to end in v2.2. Per-enchant filter E0-E4 works across every family. The `Parameters[8]` enchant fix unblocked five group families that were silently filtered out: T6_MORGANA, T6_KEEPER, T6_UNDEAD, T5_PORTAL_ROYAL_SOLO, T6_PORTAL.

### Fishing

Spawns detected and rendered. Issue #25 closed in v2.2. End-of-fishing event 61 reaches the radar but is not yet visualized.

### Basic (Legacy)

- **Chests**: shown on the radar, rarity is persisted on the entity but the drawing layer does not yet color-code by rarity (CHEST-1 follow-up).

Coming in v2.3: a Dungeons database for Avalonian and per-difficulty filters, chests rarity drawing-layer wiring, end-of-fishing visualization, Mists cluster id routing.

## Radar Controls

| Feature | Description                              |
|---------|------------------------------------------|
| Size    | 300px - 800px adjustable                 |
| Zoom    | 0.5x - 2.0x magnification                |
| Rings   | Distance indicators at 10m/20m intervals |
| Zone    | Current zone name + PvP type indicator   |
| Stats   | Player/resource/mob counts               |
| Threat  | Red pulse border on hostile detection    |
| PiP     | Picture-in-Picture floating window       |

---

## Features

### Picture-in-Picture

Playing fullscreen? Pop the radar into a floating window that stays on top. Native browser PiP, one click.

### Zone-Aware Alerts

The radar knows where you are. Safe zone? Quiet. Black Zone? Every player is a threat. Visual flash + audio alert when
hostiles appear.

### Self-Contained

Fonts, icons, everything bundled. Once Albion connects, the radar works without internet.

### Roadmap

Check [TODO.md](docs/project/TODO.md) for what's coming:

- v2.3: Dungeons database, Chests rarity, Fishing completion, Mists cluster routing
- Future: squad mode, session heatmaps

## What's New in v2.2

The stabilization release. Game updates that broke prior builds are caught up, the capture path survives ExitLag and VPN toggles, and the logging system finally makes sense.

### Radiant Wilds Protocol18 stabilization

v2.1.1 ported the wire parser to Protocol18 so the radar would speak again after the Radiant Wilds patch broke packet parsing. v2.2.0 finishes the cleanup that follows any protocol revision: Photon hashtable marshal failure that silently dropped Join responses (#78), Black Zone parameter going broken in the same revision (#87), Mist clones inheriting wrong PvP type (#103), TypeID OFFSET drift exposed across all critters (#93), 452 stale event-code values synced to upstream (#70), and a router contract pinned by pcap fixtures so the next protocol bump catches us early (#64).

### Game updates caught up

- **Mists detection**: portals, feu follets, and wisp cages back on the radar. Rarity reads from `Parameters[8]` (the same slot non-Mists dungeons use).
- **Tier and resource detection across the board**: living mob tiers match the in-game tooltip (TypeID OFFSET=16 validated on 6,469 pcap events with zero outliers); static + DEAD harvestables route through the correct filter at render time; the `-1` / `0xFFFF` mobileTypeId sentinel correctly routes to the static path.

### Network

- **Multi-interface capture**: listen on WiFi and Ethernet at the same time, so VPN starts, ExitLag activations, and WiFi-to-Ethernet handoffs no longer silence the radar.
- **ExitLag support**: cases A/B/C covered; users on the default WFP redirection should switch to NDIS (Legacy) in ExitLag's advanced settings (the README screenshots the exact path).
- **Pick interfaces from the browser**: **Settings → Network** lets you check / uncheck capture interfaces live. `network.json` with stable interface identifiers replaces `ip.txt` (one-shot migration on first boot).

### LAN access

- **Dynamic WebSocket URL**: open `http://<host-ip>:5001` from a phone, the radar just works.
- **Startup banner**: prints localhost and LAN URLs side by side.
- **Mobile responsive baseline**: every page usable at 375x667 portrait without horizontal scroll.

### Logging and pcap

- **Coherent log directories**: `logs/sessions/` for backend, `logs/debug/` for frontend, `logs/errors/` always-on, `logs/captures/` for pcap recording.
- **In-process pcap recording**: gated by a UI toggle. No more `tcpdump` to debug a parser issue.
- **Unified `/api/settings/logging` endpoint**: replaces the old single-toggle endpoint.

### UI polish

- **Icon Size slider** (0.5x-2.0x): scales markers and circles for dense screens.
- **Resource Color Badges** (toggle, off by default): for players who want a tier-first view without the game icons. When on, harvestables render as `T<tier>+<enchant>` colored squares per family; living variants get a gold border.
- **Picture-in-Picture alerts**: Pulsating Border and Screen Flash now mirror on the radar UI canvas, so PiP and overlay viewers see threats too.
- **Mist instance pvpType**: inherits from the parent cluster, no more wrong "safe" tagging in Mists.
- **Every Avalonian / Roads dungeon family back on the radar**: T6_MORGANA, T6_KEEPER, T6_UNDEAD, T5_PORTAL_ROYAL_SOLO, T6_PORTAL. Solo and Group alike were silently filtered out before.

### Stability

- **848 tests across the stack**: 591 frontend tests in 22 Vitest suites + 257 Go tests across `internal/photon`, `internal/capture`, `internal/server`, `internal/logger`, `internal/ui`, `cmd/radar`, plus tooling. Real game DBs back every test that touches the database layer.
- **Embed safety**: production binary cannot ship test files or fixtures.
- **Shutdown reliability**: pcap close ordering reworked, no more goroutine polling a freed handle.

For the full changelog see [RELEASE_2.2.0.md](docs/releases/RELEASE_2.2.0.md).

## Known Limitations

- **Player positions**: Albion encrypts movement data. Players are detected but their live positions cannot be shown on the radar without a Photon MITM proxy (out of scope). See `docs/technical/PLAYER_POSITIONS_MITM.md`.
- **Some Black Zone maps**: tiles missing for zone IDs 4000+. Workaround: disable map background in settings.
- **Event 46 unreliability**: `HarvestableChangeState` can skip size values or fire late depending on server batching. The radar reflects what the wire delivers; intermediate states the server skipped are unrecoverable.
