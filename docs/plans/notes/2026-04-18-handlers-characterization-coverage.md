# Handlers Characterization Coverage

Living counter. Updated on every test commit. Archived at plan completion.

> Suspects are pinned as `test.fails(...)` where the directional claim is unambiguous (CI green = bug still present; CI red = bug fixed, flip to regular `test`). Divergences where correctness is uncertain are kept as `@characterization` observations.

## Open observations register

### #52 tracked as `@characterization` pending ground truth

Issue #52 (living Fiber tier mismatch) is NOT a `test.fails` because direction is unresolved. Server `Parameters[7]` and DB `mob.lt` diverge for Fiber critters only (Hide agrees). Observed on radar vs in-game tooltip per #52 description does not match either value. Resolution requires #58 (typeId debug overlay) to capture the offending entity directly. Until then, two `@characterization` tests in `HarvestablesHandler.test.js` document the divergence between MobsHandler and HarvestablesHandler for mobId=529 and mobId=531.

## Open `test.fails` register

- **HARV-2** (issue #30/#32) HarvestablesHandler e0-gate blocks living Fiber spawned with charges=0; subsequent event 46 enchant update cannot recover the entity. Pinned by `test.fails('issue #30/#32: living Fiber with e0 off appears after event 46 enchant update to e=2')`. After fix: entity should appear when its specific enchant setting is enabled, regardless of e0 at spawn time.
- **HARV-3** HarvestUpdateEvent re-gate uses `isLiving=false` hardcoded and `GetStringType(harvestable.type)` with static typeNumber. Living Fiber critter (typeNumber=16) resolves to HIDE, so re-gate checks static Hide settings. Entity is removed when all static settings are disabled. Pinned by `test.fails('HarvestUpdateEvent preserves living Fiber when static settings are all disabled')`. After fix: re-gate should use the stored stringType and isLiving flag, not recompute them from typeNumber.
- **PLAY-1** (issue #65) PlayersHandler.handleNewPlayerEvent does not fire alert for hostile in unknown zone. `zonesDatabase.getPvpType(unknown)` falls back to 'safe'; `isPlayerThreat(255, 'safe')` returns false; alert gate skipped. Pinned by `synthetic hostile in unknown zone: alert should fire but does not` in `PlayersHandler.test.js`. Fix lives in `2026-04-18-alerts-and-ignore-list-design.md`.
- **PLAY-2** (issue #36) PlayersHandler.triggerHostileAlert has no ignore-list check. A player in `alreadyIgnoredPlayers` still triggers the sound alert when their faction changes to 255 in a red zone. Pinned by `synthetic PLAY-2: ignored player still triggers alert on faction change in red zone` in `PlayersHandler.test.js`. Fix lives in `2026-04-18-alerts-and-ignore-list-design.md`.
- **CHEST-1** ChestsHandler.addChestEvent crashes on undefined Parameters[3] because it calls toLowerCase() without a guard. Pinned by `test.fails('pcap-derived spawn with Parameters[3]=undefined does not throw')` in `ChestsHandler.test.js`. Fix candidate: guard with `chestName ?? ''` before `.toLowerCase()`.
- **CHEST-2** (issue #29 root cause at handler layer) ChestsHandler stores only id/pos/chestName on the Chest entity. Rarity (Parameters[5]) and related fields (Parameters[18], Parameters[23]) are discarded. The drawing layer cannot resolve chest colour because the data was never persisted. Pinned by `test.fails('pcap-derived spawn preserves Parameters[5] rarity on the stored Chest entity')` in `ChestsHandler.test.js`. Fix candidate: add rarity field to Chest class and populate from Parameters[5].
- **FISH-1** (issue #25) FishingHandler.newFishEvent drops events where Parameters[4] is an empty string `""` because `!type` treats `""` as falsy. In the pcap corpus 3 of 5 spawn events carry `type=""` with valid coordinates and are silently discarded. Likely root of fishpool not showing. Pinned by `pcap-derived spawn: entries with type="" are dropped by !type guard` in `FishingHandler.test.js`. Fix candidate: replace `!type` with `type === null || type === undefined`.

- **ROUTER-1** (issue #57) EventRouter.onResponse opcode 2 (JoinMap) does not extract `isBZ` from `Parameters[103]` hashtable. Post-Protocol18 the field is `{"5": ..., "7": ...}` (non-zero). Current code leaves `map.isBZ` at its prior value. Pinned by `test.fails('ROUTER-1: onResponse JoinMap extracts isBZ from params[103] hashtable')` in `EventRouter.test.js`. Fix design: `2026-04-18-protocol18-regressions-design.md`.

- **ROUTER-2** (issue #53) EventCodes.ChangeFlaggingFinished stale (local 359, real 363). Router case 359 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=363. Pinned by two `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`. Will flip to pass when `EventCodes.js` is refreshed.

- **ROUTER-3** (issue #53) EventCodes.Mounted stale (local 209, real 211). Router case 209 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=211. Pinned by `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

- **ROUTER-4** (issue #53) EventCodes.NewRandomDungeonExit stale (local 319, real 323). Router case 319 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=323. Pinned by `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

- **ROUTER-5** (issue #53) EventCodes.NewLootChest stale (local 387, real 391). Router case 387 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=391. Pinned by `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

- **ROUTER-6** (issue #53) EventCodes.NewFishingZoneObject stale (local 355, real 359). Router case 355 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=359. Pinned by two `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

- **ROUTER-7** (issue #53) EventCodes.FishingFinished stale (local 352, real 356). Router case 352 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=356. Pinned by `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

- **ROUTER-8** (issue #53) EventCodes.NewCagedObject stale (local 525, upstream 531). Router case 525 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=531. Pinned by `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

- **ROUTER-9** (issue #53) EventCodes.CagedObjectStateUpdated stale (local 526, upstream 532). Router case 526 never fires for real game events carrying P[252]=532. Pinned by `test.fails` in `EventRouter.test.js`.

## Decisions log

- CP1 (T17): scenario catalog ratified against inventory. Local `EventCodes.js` stale versus upstream StatisticsAnalysis; catalog uses upstream values (issues #53, #54 already track this). Fixture corpus committed covers 16 of 19 declared scenarios. Missing: `fishing/finished`, `wispcage/spawn`, `wispcage/opened` (not observable in this capture).
