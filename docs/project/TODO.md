- [x] Trace analysis tooling (tools/analyze_trace.py)
- [x] Verified: 47% reduction in event listener accumulation
- [x] Verified: 30% reduction in DOM node growth

#### CDN to Local Migration (2025-12-20)

- [x] Lucide icons: CDN → `/scripts/vendors/lucide.min.js`
- [x] HTMX: CDN → `/scripts/vendors/htmx.min.js`
- [x] Google Fonts → local woff2 files in `/styles/fonts/`
    - JetBrains Mono (400, 500)
    - Space Grotesk (400, 500, 700)
- [x] fonts.css with @font-face declarations
- [x] Removed external CDN dependencies (offline-capable)

#### SPA Navigation & Lifecycle (2025-12-19)

- [x] PageController.js for page init/destroy orchestration
- [x] WebSocketManager.js for robust WS connection handling
- [x] HTMX integration for partial page rendering
- [x] Page visibility handling (WS pause/resume)
- [x] Resource page lifecycle with memory leak prevention
- [x] Database caching across navigations
- [x] Settings restoration on F5 refresh
- [x] Dynamic imports for lazy loading (radar page)

#### Player Detection Overhaul

- [x] Fix faction detection using Parameters[53] (not Parameters[11])
- [x] Create FactionConstants.js (Faction enum, helpers)
- [x] Add Player methods: isHostile(), isPassive(), isFactionPlayer()
- [x] Implement Event 359 (ChangeFlaggingFinished) handler
- [x] Player list UI with 3 sections (Hostile/Faction/Passive)
- [x] Zone-aware threat detection

#### Zone System

- [x] Create ZonesDatabase.js with PvP type detection
- [x] Add zones.json generation from ao-bin-dumps
- [x] Zone-based alert logic (black zone = all players hostile)
- [x] Enhanced zone info display (name, tier, PvP indicator)

#### UI/UX Improvements

- [x] DaisyUI components integration
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 with DaisyUI theming
- [x] Player cards with threat-based color coding
- [x] Stats component with player counts by type
- [x] Responsive player list sections

#### Performance

- [x] WebSocketEventQueue with coalescing & throttling
- [x] Event batching (Move, HealthUpdate events)
- [x] Settings-controlled optimization toggles
- [x] Dead code cleanup

#### Technical Debt

- [x] Remove VirtualScroll (unused)
- [x] Remove accordion.js (DaisyUI handles collapse)
- [x] Remove tooltips.css (DaisyUI handles tooltips)
- [x] ESLint config for underscore-prefixed unused vars

## v2.2 - Detection Refactoring (Next)

### Priority: Complete Detection Systems

The following systems need refactoring like Resources/Mobs/Players:
- Database-driven detection
- Proper event handlers
- Stale entity cleanup
- Settings-based filtering
- Classification system

#### Dungeons
- [ ] Create DungeonsDatabase.js (types, tiers, difficulties)
- [ ] Add stale entity cleanup
- [ ] Improve classification (Solo/Group/Corrupted/Hellgate/Avalonian)
- [ ] Add filtering by type in settings

#### Chests
- [ ] Create ChestsDatabase.js (rarities, types)
- [ ] Add stale entity cleanup
- [ ] Classification by rarity (Common/Uncommon/Rare/Legendary)
- [ ] Add filtering in settings

#### Mists
- [ ] Implement 19 event handlers (events 513-531)
- [ ] Add missing event codes in EventCodes.js
- [ ] Create proper MistsHandler.js
- [ ] Track Mists entrances/exits
- [ ] Wisp cages detection

#### Fishing
- [ ] Complete FishingHandler.js (TODOs in code)
- [ ] Add fishing zones on radar
- [ ] Fishing state tracking

### Priority: Map Improvements
- [ ] Blackzone map tiles extraction from Albion client
- [ ] Map tile size normalization (fix stretching on small zones)
- [ ] Map centering optimization (background alignment)
- [ ] Map scaling for different zone sizes

---

## v2.3+ - Future (Backlog)

### Stability & Performance
- [ ] Memory usage optimization for long sessions
- [ ] BZ portal transitions fix

### Other Improvements
- [ ] Quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] Configuration file support

---

## Known Limitations

### Player Positions (Permanent)
- Position tracking impossible - Albion encrypts movement data
- Players detected but coordinates unavailable
- No fix possible - this is by design from Albion
- Player dots on radar disabled (would render at 0,0)

### Blackzone Maps
- Some blackzone map tiles missing (4000+, 5000+ IDs)
- Workaround: Disable "Show Map Background" in Settings
- Solution: Extract tiles from Albion client

### Resource Charges
- Remaining charges display may be inaccurate
- Server counts harvest bonus differently
- No fix possible (missing server-side data)

## Live validation pending

- **#91 ExitLag free trial smoke** : after the dynamic capture interface PR lands, activate ExitLag's 3-day free trial and verify radar continuity in the four cases A/B/C/D documented in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-26-dynamic-capture-interface-design.md`. If Case D (NDIS LWF swallows packets) materializes, open a follow-up issue for WFP-level capture investigation.
