# Release 2.2.0, Protocol18 + Mists + Multi-interface

This release closes the stabilization phase that started in April 2026. The big rocks: a full Protocol18 port with pcap-fixture-backed tests, Mists detection restored end to end, multi-interface capture (ExitLag, VPN, WiFi-to-Ethernet handoff), a coherent logging system with in-process pcap recording, LAN access from any device on the network, and a real test harness across 14 handler suites.

## Highlights

### Protocol18 port

The deserializer was rewritten for Protocol18. Every Photon event type the radar consumes ships with a pcap fixture in `internal/photon/testdata/` and a Go test that reads the fixture via `gopacket` and asserts on the decoded payload. The router contract is pinned by a table-driven test (#64) on real codes: `Move (22)`, `JoinFinished (2)`, `ChangeCluster (41)`, with expected parameter keys.

### Single source of truth for Albion codes (#70)

JS event codes and operation codes live in `web/scripts/utils/EventCodes.js` and `OperationCodes.js`; Go mirrors regenerate via `make refresh-codes`. The sync pass surfaced 452 stale event-code values in the local copy versus upstream `StatisticsAnalysisTool`: 61 new names added, 15 legacy names dropped (Carriable, Journal, AntiCheat, RedZoneCluster, DebugMobInfo families). 540 operation codes imported with their own Go mirror. Eight `test.fails` (`ROUTER-2..9`) flipped to `@verified` after the sync. Four `OPS-1..4` literals retained in `EventRouter.js` with `FIXME ops-drift` comments because the upstream name does not match the local handler semantics; resolution requires pcap-backed investigation.

### Mists detection (#78, closes #24, #66, #69, #80)

Three Mists-side bugs fixed in the same PR:

1. The `MobsDrawing` mist enchant filter was inverted: checking E0 hid mists instead of showing them. With every E0..E4 box ticked by default, every mist was hidden.
2. `WispCageHandler` read the wrong parameter slots and rejected real events with a wrong `undefined` gate. Capture-70 corpus pinned the correct layout.
3. Photon hashtable marshal failure silently dropped Join responses (`Parameters[103]` shape changed in Protocol18 from scalar to `hashtable{5,7}`). A custom `MarshalJSON` fix on the hashtable type unblocks Mists instance map render.

### Dungeons restored across every family (#78)

The enchant source for dungeons moved from `Parameters[6]` (a dungeon type id with values 2, 37-39, 229, 276, 310, 327, never in the 0-4 enchant range) to `Parameters[8]` (the real 0-4 enchant). The drawing-layer gate `settingDungeonE<n>` could never match the wrong values, so every group dungeon family was silently filtered out. After the fix, `T6_MORGANA`, `T6_KEEPER`, `T6_UNDEAD`, `T5_PORTAL_ROYAL_SOLO`, and `T6_PORTAL` are back on the radar with their correct enchant level.

Live evidence covered both sides: a "Peu commun" `MISTS_SOLO_YELLOW` portal with `Parameters[8]=1` matches the in-game tooltip, a `T6_MORGANA` with `Parameters[8]=2` correctly maps to an E2 dungeon. The MISTS-specific branch in `addDungeon` is preserved so MISTS portals route through the Mists settings (`settingMistSolo/Duo` plus `settingMistE<enchant>`) instead of the Dungeon settings.

Per-type filters validated end to end: Solo (`settingDungeonSolo`), Group (`settingDungeonDuo`), Corrupted (`settingDungeonCorrupted`), Hellgate (`settingDungeonHellgate`). Combined with the per-enchant filters E0-E4, the user can now narrow the dungeon view by both family and rarity. Avalonian dungeons, per-difficulty filters, and a dungeons database stay on the v2.3 backlog.

### Fishing closed (#73, #85, closes #25)

Two complementary fixes:

- `FishingHandler.newFishEvent` rejected every spawn with an empty-string `type` because the guard was `if (!type) return`. Three of five fishpool spawns in the live corpus carry `type=""`. The guard is now `if (type === null || type === undefined) return`, which preserves the original intent (drop missing data) without silently discarding valid data (#73, FISH-1).
- The `settingFishing` gate moved from spawn time to render time, so toggling fishing visibility takes effect on the next frame instead of waiting for new spawns (#85).

Spawns are now detected, interpolated, and visualized. End-of-fishing (event 61) is logged but not yet drawn on the radar; that is the only remaining gap.

### Multi-interface capture (#94)

Albion traffic can change route while the game runs: ExitLag toggle, VPN start, WiFi-to-Ethernet handoff. The radar listens on every selected interface in parallel. The single-handle keyed by IP is gone.

`internal/capture/manager.go` owns the active capturer set, diffs against the target on `Reconfigure`, opens new handles before closing old ones so the radar never has zero capturers during a swap. Persistence moved from `ip.txt` to `network.json` with stable `{name, description}` identifiers; the legacy file migrates once on first boot and is then deleted. Interfaces are categorized (WiFi, Ethernet, ExitLag, VPN, Virtual, Other) with a regex order that puts virtual NICs last (#106 recovers this ordering after it was lost in a squash and adds three unit tests). The settings UI exposes the categorization with badges. `POST /api/network/interfaces` is loopback-only: a phone on the LAN can read the state but cannot retarget the host's capture.

Architecture write-up: `docs/technical/CAPTURE_INTERFACES.md`.

### ExitLag support (#99)

Capture survives ExitLag's NDIS Lightweight Filter in cases A, B, and C documented in `CAPTURE_INTERFACES.md`. The README explains how to switch ExitLag's packet redirection to "NDIS (Legacy)" so Npcap (and Wireshark) can see the traffic. Case D (LWF swallows packets entirely) would need WFP-level capture and is out of scope.

### Logging coherence and pcap recording (#107)

Backend and frontend logs no longer mix. Each output channel has a clear meaning:

| Source | Level | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| Backend Go | DEBUG/INFO/WARN | `logs/sessions/` (gated) |
| Backend Go | ERROR/CRITICAL | `logs/sessions/` (gated) plus `logs/errors/` (always-on) |
| Frontend | DEBUG/INFO/WARN | `logs/debug/` |
| Frontend | ERROR/CRITICAL | `logs/debug/` plus `logs/errors/` |

Configuration moved from `localStorage` to `network.json` so the backend boots with the correct gate state without waiting for the frontend to push a value. A unified `/api/settings/logging` GET/POST endpoint replaces the old `/api/settings/server-logs`; the change is breaking for any client that still calls the old path (none in the wild).

In-process pcap recording is gated by a UI toggle. `Capturer.StartRecording(dir)` writes a `capture_<timestamp>_<sanitized-iface>.pcap` per active interface. `pcapgo.Writer` keeps frame metadata so the output is replayable through `pcap.OpenOffline`. No more external `tcpdump` to debug a parser issue. The PR also fixes a latent bug where `POST /api/network/interfaces` was wiping the `Logging` section of `network.json` because it wrote a fresh `Config{CaptureInterfaces: ...}` instead of merging via `MutateConfig`.

Architecture write-up: `docs/technical/LOGGING.md`.

### Settings coherence (#85, closes #81, #65, #25)

Audit of the settings page surface that uncovered several phantom toggles and out-of-sync gates:

- Orphan keys aligned (`settingShowFish` -> `settingFishing`, etc.) so a checkbox actually controls the gate it claims to.
- Screen Flash mirrored on the radar UI canvas in addition to the full-viewport DOM overlay. Users focused on the radar window or in Picture-in-Picture mode now see the alert.
- Pulsating Border is zone-aware (fires on faction-flagged players in Black Zones, not just on hostile flag) AND draws on the radar UI canvas, so it shows on the overlay and in PiP just like Screen Flash. The pulsation itself is more visible too (wider amplitude, more blur, thicker stroke). The new `settingFlashDangerousPlayer` checkbox in the Alerts page exposes the toggle that previously had only render-side wiring.
- Fishing and Enemy spawn gates moved from spawn-time drop to render-time filter, matching the resource path. Toggling a category mid-session no longer requires a teleport to refresh the radar.
- Logger default is `enabled: false`. The frontend POSTs the persisted state on settings page load, so the gate is correct from the first event.

User test 2026-04-24 confirmed the four observable symptoms.

### Living harvest tier (#77, closes #52)

Living mob tiers on the radar match the in-game tooltip. The `getLivingHarvestTier` rule resolves the live tier as `max(min_tier(loot_type), combat_tier - 1)` for non-DYNAMIC, non-DEAD mobs; DYNAMIC and DEAD variants keep the combat tier. Validated against 9 pcap-derived examples and 4 user screenshots across the Hide and Fiber-critter families.

### TypeID OFFSET fix (#93, closes #92)

The earlier `t-1` shift on living non-DYNAMIC critters was a compensation for a TypeID OFFSET drift, not a game-tier rule. Validation against 6469 pcap NewMob events plus 5889 session-log events at OFFSET=16 returned zero outliers; the previous OFFSET=15 was a never-HP-verified deduction. The shift was retired, `MobsDatabase.OFFSET` is 16, and `getLivingHarvestTier` reduces to `mob.t`. The PR also ships diagnostic plumbing: `Show DB Name` overlay (`settingLivingResourcesName`), `CritterCorpseTierAudit` log, and the `tools/offset-validate` Go binary so the next DB refresh can re-anchor the offset in one command.

### Render-time filter for living and DEAD (#82, closes #32, #30)

The spawn-time filter that dropped living resources when a setting was off has been replaced by a per-frame render gate. Toggling a setting now affects display without waiting for new spawns. DEAD carcasses are explicitly routed through the Living filter (verified by user test 2026-04-24): a corpse is part of the same critter family as the alive variant, not a static node. `LivingResourceFilter.js` exports `shouldRenderLivingResource` and `shouldRenderStaticResource` via a shared `resolveSettingsCell`.

### Static and edge fixes

- `mobileTypeId === -1` treated as static, since `-1` is the int16 decode of `0xFFFF` sentinel (#71, HARV-1).
- `Parameters[3]` type guard in `addChestEvent`: undefined or non-string values fall through cleanly (#72).
- Re-gate reads the stored `mobileTypeId` instead of hardcoding `isLiving=false`. Living Fiber critters no longer drop when static Hide settings are disabled (#74, HARV-3).
- Chest rarity persisted from `Parameters[5]` on the entity (#75, CHEST-2). The drawing layer does not yet consume it: rarity badge wiring is a follow-up. The source identification of the rarity slot itself stays open (CHEST-1).
- Black Zone detection works again on every map transition (#87, closes #57). `Parameters[103]` shifted from a scalar to a hashtable in Protocol18 and the direct parse silently returned the wrong value, which let a player walk into a Black Zone without the radar flipping `map.isBZ` and arming the threat-alert pipeline. The fix derives `map.isBZ` from `zonesDatabase.getPvpType(mapId)`, which works on every join and zone change, not just Mist instances. The direct hashtable parse stays pinned by `ROUTER-1` `test.fails` as a follow-up.
- Mists instance pvpType inherits from the parent cluster: a Mist clone keyed by `@MISTS@<guid>` carries the BZ/YZ classification of the cluster the player came from. Faction or hostile alarms fire correctly in BZ Mists; Yellow Royal Mists no longer trip the alarm (#103, closes #90). Override persisted to `sessionStorage`.

### LAN access (#88)

The frontend builds the WebSocket URL from `window.location` instead of `ws://localhost:5001/ws`. A phone or second laptop loading `http://<server-ip>:5001` gets a working radar without configuration. The startup banner prints the LAN URL alongside `localhost` when the host adapter has a routable RFC1918 IP. A `_WebSocketManager.test.js` covers the four URL shapes (localhost, RFC1918, https, no port).

A minimal mobile responsive pass made every page usable at 375x667 portrait: no horizontal scrollbars, canvas readable, settings forms collapse correctly. Not a redesign, just a sanity baseline.

### UI polish (#105, closes #98)

- **Icon Size slider** (0.5x to 2.0x) scales markers and circles, not text or healthbars.
- **Resource Color Badges** toggle replaces the single-dot indicator with a colored tier square per resource family (Fiber green, Hide tan, Wood brown, Ore blue, Rock purple), plus a gold border on living variants.
- **Hostile NPC circle radius** tightened from 7 to 6 to match the visual weight of the new badges.
- **Collapsible Network card** in the radar overlay; state persists across navigation.

### Stability and shutdown (#63)

- `pcap.BlockForever` swapped for a 500 ms timeout so an idle close unblocks instead of hanging on a goroutine still polling.
- Handle close ordering: cancel context, wait, only then close. libpcap is unsafe to close while `Read` is in flight.
- TUI dashboard panic on first `LogMsg` arriving before `WindowSizeMsg` guarded: drop the log instead of calling `SetContent` on an unsized viewport.
- Reproduced the original deadlock on 2.1.1 and confirmed clean exit on the fix.

### Test harness (#68)

591 frontend tests across 22 suites at release time. The discipline introduced by #68 is `@verified`, `@characterization`, `test.fails`: most assertions are verified, characterization is reserved for observed behavior under directional uncertainty, and `test.fails` pins known bugs (CI green while broken, red when fixed). 16 pcap-derived scenarios shipped at #68, all PII-scrubbed; the corpus has grown with each subsequent fix PR. Tools added in the same PR:

- `tools/anonymize-pcap`: scrubs MAC, IP, timestamps, optional `--scrub-string` for the local player name.
- `tools/photon-dump`: extracts per-scenario fixtures from a live pcap, both as `.pcap` fragments and as WS-level JSON matching the EventRouter dispatch format.
- `tools/gen-eventcodes`: regenerates Go mirrors from the JS source files.
- `tools/offset-validate`: anchors the TypeID OFFSET against a fresh DB.

Bugs pinned by `test.fails` at the start of the cycle: HARV-1/2/3, PLAY-1/2, CHEST-1/2, FISH-1, ROUTER-1..9. By release time, only PLAY-1, PLAY-2, ROUTER-1, and CHEST-1 remain open.

### Embed safety (#86)

17 test files renamed to `_*.test.js`. Go embed's default rule excludes `_*` so the production binary cannot ship test artifacts. Production binary trimmed by 347 KB. `embed_prod_test.go` walks the embed FS at test time and asserts no fixture or test file landed. CI guard rejects unprefixed `*.test.js`.

## Detection details

| System | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Resources | working | static and living, T1-T8, enchantments, render-time filter post #82 |
| Mobs | working | OFFSET=16 confirmed, color-coded threat |
| Players | working | faction detection, zone-aware alerts (Mist instances inherit parent pvpType post #103), ignore list |
| Mists | working | portals, feu follets, wisp cages |
| Dungeons | working | per-type filters Solo, Group (Duo), Corrupted, Hellgate validated end to end; per-enchant filters E0-E4 work across every family. Five group families unblocked by #78: T6_MORGANA, T6_KEEPER, T6_UNDEAD, T5_PORTAL_ROYAL_SOLO, T6_PORTAL. Avalonian, per-difficulty filters, and a dungeon database stay on the v2.3 backlog. |
| Chests | basic | rarity persisted on the entity (#75); drawing-layer color resolution and the rarity source slot itself are follow-ups |
| Fishing | working | issue #25 closed via #73 (empty-string spawn type accepted) and #85 (render-time gate). Spawns detected and interpolated. Event 61 (end-of-fishing) is logged but not yet visualized; that is the only remaining gap. |

## Migration notes

- `ip.txt` is replaced by `network.json`. Migration runs once on first boot if `ip.txt` exists; the file is deleted afterwards.
- `localStorage.settingServerLogsEnabled` is overwritten by the value from `network.json` on the first settings page load. The toggle state carries over without user action.
- The `/api/settings/server-logs` endpoint is replaced by `/api/settings/logging` (GET and POST). Old single-toggle clients break; none are in the wild.
- `protocol16.go` is gone. The deserializer is now a cluster: `deserializer.go`, `packet.go`, `events.go`, `readers.go`, `types.go`, `typecodes.go`.

## Known limitations

- Player live positions stay encrypted (XOR with a KeySync `XorCode` itself wrapped by Photon AES). Out of scope without a MITM proxy. See `docs/technical/PLAYER_POSITIONS_MITM.md`.
- Some Black Zone map tiles missing for zone IDs 4000+. Workaround: disable the map background in settings.
- Event 46 (`HarvestableChangeState`) occasionally skips size values (e.g. 3 -> 1) or fires late, depending on server batching and network conditions. The radar reflects whatever the wire delivers; intermediate states that the server skipped are unrecoverable. See `docs/technical/HARVEST_EVENTS.md`.

## What's next

`docs/project/TODO.md` carries the v2.3 backlog. Priority: a dungeons database with per-type filter (Solo, Group, Corrupted, Hellgate, Avalonian), Chests rarity source identification (CHEST-1) plus drawing-layer wiring, end-of-fishing visualization (event 61), Mists cluster id routing (events 518/519/520/529 reach the frontend but no handler consumes them).
